## Hey there, I’m Eric. 👋

Hello there! I’m Eric, a 29-year-old nerd that’s figuring out his place on this giant spinning rock we call Earth.

The name of this site is tied to how I’m tending to this “digital garden” and creating the life I want in between the various responsibilities in my life.

Feel free to come on in, kick back, and stay a while!

### Check out my tech endeavors

I’m a hobbyist programmer and tinkerer - I love putting together stuff that ranges from home servers to automating everyday tasks.

### My Relationship with Writing

I find a lot of value in reading about others’ life experiences - be it in the areas of technology, random musings, mental health, or even mundane accounts. So instead of just always reading, I thought I’d try my hand at sharing my own. Maybe they’ll resonate with someone out there, just like others’ have with me.

### Painting with Light as Therapy

I got into photography back in high school and fell in love with it. I even studied it in college, but trying to turn it into a career kind of sucked the joy out of it for me. Since then, I’ve been trying to bring it back into my life more as a therapeutic tool - help calm and slow down my ever racing mind.
