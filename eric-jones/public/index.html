<h3 id="my-relationship-with-writing">My Relationship with Writing</h3>
<p>I find a lot of value in reading about others‚Äô life experiences - be it in the areas of technology, random musings, mental health, or even mundane accounts. So instead of just always reading, I thought I‚Äôd try my hand at sharing my own. Maybe they‚Äôll resonate with someone out there, just like others‚Äô have with me.</p>
<h3 id="painting-with-light-as-therapy">Painting with Light as Therapy</h3>
<p>I got into photography back in high school and fell in love with it. I even studied it in college, but trying to turn it into a career kind of sucked the joy out of it for me. Since then, I‚Äôve been trying to bring it back into my life more as a therapeutic tool - help calm and slow down my ever racing mind.</p>
