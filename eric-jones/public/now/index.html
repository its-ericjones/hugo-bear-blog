This page is inspired by Derek Sivers’s post - /now page movement and the Now Movement.
The purpose of this page is to share what I’m currently focusing my energy towards (long and short term goals) and will update as things change.
What am I up to right now?

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science degree in Information Technology
I’m currently employed at a Tech company working in Inventory Management
I’m writing about various technical and personal topics
I’m diving more headfirst into self hosted solutions
I’m starting to create more scripts to help automate repetitive tasks in my life (more blog posts on these to come)

What are my interests?

Writing
Reading
Photography
FOSS (Free Open Source Software)
Decentralization
Automation
GNU / Linux

Which Operating Systems do I use?

On the mobile side, I’m an iOS user
On the laptop/desktop side, I’m a macOS / Ubuntu Linux user
On the server side, I’m an Ubuntu Linux user

Daily Drivers

My phone is an iPhone 16 Pro Max
My laptop is a MacBook Pro 16” / Dell XPS 15”
My servers are a 2024 Mac Mini and Intel NUC
